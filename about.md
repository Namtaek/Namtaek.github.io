### About Me

I'm broadly interested in __Statistics and machine learning.__.

I am not a fully Bayesian, however, I think Bayesian inference is more informative despite its computational issues.

My research involves causal inference, especially "confounder selection", and Bayesian nonparametrics such as BART.

I am currently a Master's student of __BCIG, Bayesian Causal Inference Group__.

After completing my Bachelor's degree at Sungkyunkwan University, I am conducting a master's degree course under Prof. Chanmin Kim in Sungkyunkwan University.
